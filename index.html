Well if we refer to this line in todays time I find it quite funny because haven’t we all become professionals in doing multiple things especially on ‘the internet’,but when it comes to reading I am  sure everyone of you likes at least a particular genre for reading; be it sci-fi,drama,fantasy or even fan fictions and many more, luckily for us all, we have our very own D.E.A.R week  in which we just Drop Everything And Read .</p>

            <h4>In today’s world where most of our time is spent in front of a screen, so much so that we don’t even have a choice to do otherwise. One of the many things being affected by this is our fitness, it’s being neglected. 

                A wise man once said, “where there is a will there’s a way”. All that we need is a little bit of a push, some motivation and that’s exactly what the ‘khelo India freedom run’ is. It is the incentive for people to get independence from obesity, laziness, stress and anxiety. 
                
                It is based around the concept of flexibility, another little teaspoon of freedom. It gives runners the choice to :
                
                                 – Run a route of their choice, at a time that suits them.

            <h4> Our biggest motivation behind this initiative was our students and their futures. social distancing came with some challenges of creating regular classroom environments for the students and risking their personal contact with teachers and their friends, which we believe are the most important aspects of their schooling years. However, we were able to introduce a system with maximum virtual socializing.
                It is a known fact that children learn best when they learn together. Keeping in mind our learners’ needs, facetime (live) classes are conducted every day along with independent learning opportunities.
